# Analyze bookstore sales with Python

My mission here for Lapage is to analyse the strengths, weaknesses and customer behavior of Lapage.

I was also asked to analyze the relationship between a customer's gender and the categories of books purchased, and then the link between the customers'age and the total amount of purchases, the purchase frequency, the average basket size and the categories of books purchased.
